# Q1. What's the difference between module,  library , and Package in Python?
Ans: In Python, the terms "module," "library," and "package" refer to different concepts in the organization and structuring of code:

1. **Module:**
   - A module in Python is a single file containing Python code. It can define functions, classes, and variables that can be reused in other Python scripts or modules.
   - Modules allow code organization and encapsulation, making it easier to manage and maintain large codebases.

   Example: If you have a file named `my_module.py` containing some functions, you can use those functions in another script by importing the module.

   ```python
   # my_module.py
   def my_function():
       print("Hello from my_function!")

   # another_script.py
   import my_module

   my_module.my_function()
   ```

2. **Library:**
   - In Python, a library (or Python library) is a collection of modules that provide related functionality. A library typically consists of multiple modules bundled together to solve specific problems or offer a set of related features.
   - Libraries can be standard libraries (included with Python) or third-party libraries (developed by the community).

   Example: The Python Standard Library includes a variety of modules for tasks such as file I/O (`os` module), working with regular expressions (`re` module), and handling dates and times (`datetime` module).

   ```python
   # Using modules from the Python Standard Library
   import os
   import re
   import datetime
   ```

3. **Package:**
   - A package in Python is a way of organizing related modules into a directory hierarchy. A package is essentially a directory that contains a special file named `__init__.py` (which can be empty) and other Python modules or sub-packages.
   - Packages provide a way to structure and organize code at a higher level than individual modules.

   Example: If you have a directory structure like this:

   ```
   my_package/
   ├── __init__.py
   ├── module1.py
   └── module2.py
   ```

   You can import modules from the package in another script:

   ```python
   # Using modules from a package
   from my_package import module1, module2
   ```

In summary, a module is a single Python file, a library is a collection of related modules, and a package is a way of organizing related modules into a directory hierarchy. Together, they provide a structured and modular approach to organizing and reusing code in Python.

# Q1.a) Then how the library is different from the package in Python?
Ans: In Python, both libraries and packages are used for organizing and structuring code, but they serve different purposes:

1. **Library:**
   - A library in Python is a collection of modules. It can be a set of related functionalities bundled together. A library is often a cohesive unit, addressing a specific domain or providing a specific set of tools.
   - Libraries can be either part of the Python Standard Library (which comes with Python) or third-party libraries developed by the community. Standard libraries are included with Python installations, while third-party libraries need to be installed separately.

   Example:
   ```python
   # Using modules from the Python Standard Library (a form of a library)
   import os
   import re
   ```

2. **Package:**
   - A package, on the other hand, is a way of organizing related modules into a directory hierarchy. It's essentially a directory that contains a special file named `__init__.py` (which can be empty) and other Python modules or sub-packages.
   - Packages provide a higher-level organizational structure than individual modules, allowing for more complex projects to be organized in a modular and hierarchical manner.

   Example:
   ```
   my_package/
   ├── __init__.py
   ├── module1.py
   └── module2.py
   ```

   Importing modules from a package:
   ```python
   # Using modules from a package
   from my_package import module1, module2
   ```

In summary, the key difference lies in their organization and structure:

- A library is a collection of related modules, often bundled together for a specific purpose, and can include both standard libraries and third-party libraries.
  
- A package is a way of organizing related modules into a directory hierarchy. It is a higher-level organizational unit that allows for a more structured and modular approach to organizing code.

In practice, you'll often encounter libraries that consist of packages and modules. For instance, a data science library might have modules for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning, organized into a package structure.


# Q2. Difference among %, /, // in Python?
Ans: In Python, `%`, `/`, and `//` are operators used for different mathematical operations:

1. **Percentage (`%`):**
   - In Python, the `%` operator is used for the modulus operation. It returns the remainder of the division of the left operand by the right operand.
   - Example: `a % b` returns the remainder when `a` is divided by `b`.

     ```python
     result = 10 % 3  # Result is 1, because 10 divided by 3 is 3 with a remainder of 1
     ```

2. **Division (`/`):**
   - The `/` operator is used for regular division. It returns a floating-point result of the division operation.
   - Example: `a / b` returns the result of dividing `a` by `b`, and the result is a floating-point number.

     ```python
     result = 10 / 3  # Result is 3.3333333333333335
     ```

3. **Floor Division (`//`):**
   - The `//` operator is used for floor division. It returns the largest integer less than or equal to the division result. In other words, it truncates the decimal part of the result.
   - Example: `a // b` returns the integer division of `a` by `b`.

     ```python
     result = 10 // 3  # Result is 3, because it discards the decimal part
     ```

In summary:
- `%` gives the remainder of a division.
- `/` performs regular division, resulting in a floating-point number.
- `//` performs floor division, resulting in an integer by discarding the decimal part.

Example:

```python
a = 10
b = 3

remainder = a % b  # Result is 1
division_result = a / b  # Result is 3.3333333333333335
floor_division_result = a // b  # Result is 3
```
